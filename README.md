# Getting Started

Below are the instructions on how to install, configure and generate a Kaminario K2 Array As Built Report

## Pre-requisites
The following PowerShell modules are required for generating a Kaminario K2 Array As Built report.

Each of these modules can be easily downloaded and installed via the PowerShell Gallery 

- [Kaminario K2 Powershell](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/K2.Powershell/)
- [AsBuiltReport Module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AsBuiltReport/)

### Module Installation

Open a Windows PowerShell terminal window and install each of the required modules as follows;
```powershell
Install-Module -Name K2.Powershell
Install-Module AsBuiltReport
```

### Required Privileges

To generate a Kaminario K2 report, a user account with the readonly role or higher on the Array(s) is required.

## Configuration

The Kaminario K2 Array As Built Report utilises a JSON file to allow configuration of report information, options, detail and healthchecks.

A Kaminario K2 Array report configuration file can be generated by executing the following command;
```powershell
New-AsBuiltReportConfig -Report Kaminario.K2 -Path <User specified folder> -Name <Optional> -Credential (Get-Credential)
```

Executing this command will copy the default FlashArray report JSON configuration to a user specified folder.

All report settings can then be configured via the JSON file.

The following provides information of how to configure each schema within the report's JSON file.

<Placeholder for future - there are currently no configurable options for the Kaminario K2 Report>
